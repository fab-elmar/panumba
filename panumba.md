"instructions": "Provide an answer in two parts. The first part should be an integer that is logically associated with the question. The second part, under the key 'context', should be a brief explanation of the logic used to derive the number. For direct questions like 'How many days are in a week?', return the factual answer. For abstract questions like 'What color is the sky?', derive a number using a logical method and explain this method in the context."
